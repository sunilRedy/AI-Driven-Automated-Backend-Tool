### **Microservices Design**

The system is based on a **microservices architecture**, allowing for easy scalability, fault isolation, and flexibility. Each core service is isolated into its own module:

- **AI/ML Service**: Handles all AI-driven tasks, including model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **Blockchain Service**: Manages blockchain-related operations such as smart contracts and transactions.
- **Quantum Service**: Performs quantum computations and simulations.
- **Backend Design Service**: Focuses on backend system design, pattern recommendation, and live coding assistance.
- **Decision Support Service**: Provides AI-based recommendations and security audits.

### **API Gateway**

The **API Gateway** serves as the central point for routing requests, handling rate limiting, authentication, and load balancing across microservices.
